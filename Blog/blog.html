<h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment? How did you solve them?</h2>

<p id = "w1p" style="margin-left: 40px" > The only real hang up I had was trying to get my IDE to communicate effectively with
    github. Also, setting up github and making sure everything updated correctly. It took me a minute to realize that I
    couldn't create a file structure on github directly. I instead created the files on my local machine and then pushed
    them there. Also, my IDE has a button to commit, but commit doesn't equal push.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>

<p id = "w1p" style="margin-left: 40px">Well, I learned everything that I did on this page. I haven't really played around with
    html before, and what little I had done was nearly a decade ago. It seems pretty straightforward so far. I wanted
    everything to be indented correctly, so I googled how to do that.</p>

<h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>

<p id = "w1p" style="margin-left: 40px">The most helpful resource for me personally has always been any "Head First" book.
Some people love these books and others hate them. The abstract way they present the information is conducive to
my learning style. </p>

<img id = "w1i" style = "margin-left: 40px" src="HeadsUpHTML.jpg" height = "300" width = "">

<p id = "w1p" style="margin-left: 40px">Other than that book, searching the internet for the specifics of exactly what I'm
trying to figure out, is usually the fastest solution. One website that I came across was
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools.com</a>. </p>

<script>
    $("#Week1").click(function () {
        $("#w1p,#w1i").slideToggle("slow");
    });

<h2>General thoughts and notes:</h2>

<p id = "w2p" style="margin-left: 40px">Last week I had thought that I had github functioning correctly. Turns out, I did not. While
    signing up for a github account, I mistakenly created a private repo (which is cool actually) and pushed my assignment to
    that. Well, that's great and all, but there is no way for the instructor to view it. One thing that I didn't seem to
    comprehend was the differing github accounts. It's actually kind of embarrassing for me. The trouble was, I was logged in to
    github, but didn't comprehend that the classroom repo was where I was to push my files. I interpreted it as if it were a
    set of instructions. </p>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have? How did you solve those problems?</h2>

<p id = "w2p" style="margin-left: 40px">I'm using Webstorm to learn to code on. I want to be able to clone repos easily and keep them all in the
same local directory. I've been struggling to get that functioning correctly.</p>

<p id = "w2p" style="margin-left: 40px">This assignment was overwhelming initially; I just didn't know where to start. After a bit of trial and error, I started to
get the hang of it. One thing though, I didn't use bootstrap. I guess, I don't understand how to use it?? I downloaded the
files but I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with them.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

<p id = "w2p" style="margin-left: 40px">I learned a lot about CSS. I've never used it before. I still havent quite figured out how to
align "twit-attribution" the way I want. I tried a ton of different approaches, but couldn't get it quite right. The flow layout
is kind of similar to how Java handles layout, so I suppose knowing a bit of Java helped.</p>

<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

<p id = "w2p" style="margin-left: 40px"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools.com</a> has been a pretty awesome resource.
    Other than that, I googled specific questions and looked for different approaches to whatever problem I was trying to figure out.
</p>

<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

<p id = "w2p" style="margin-left: 40px">How to make a button stay in a position even when scrolling.  </p>

    $("#Week2").click(function () {
        $("#w2p").slideToggle("slow");
    });
