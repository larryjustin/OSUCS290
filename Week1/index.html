<h1>CS290, Summer 2017</h1>
<h3>Name:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Hello, my name is Larry Justin Eckert. I prefer to be called Justin. (Hence the full name)</p>
<h3>Major and Year:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">My major is Computer Science, systems option and this is my second year of study.</p>
<h3>Web Development Skill Confidence:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">On a scale of 0-10, I'd put myself at a 2. I've played with html years ago, but in the
meantime, I've been playing with python, java and a little bit of C.</p>
<h3>Class Hopes and Dreams:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">I hope to learn how to construct a basic website. I'd like to be able to put a site together from
scratch and host my projects/hobbies on there. Not so much to show off to the world, moreso to keep
track of what I did and when.</p>
<h3>Piazza:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">I have signed up for Piazza.</p>
<h3>Interesting Facts, or lack thereof:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">There's nothing insanely interesting about me, but I do enjoy learning how things work. I've built
cars, computers, electronics, etc. I love taking things apart or seeing if they could be improved. My
most unique experience was the time I spent in the military. I loved and hated it and it doesnt define
who I am as a person. I hate it when people just can't move on from that life....but to each their own.</p>
<h3>Selfie:</h3>
