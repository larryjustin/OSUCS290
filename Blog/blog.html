<h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment? How did you solve them?</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> The only real hang up I had was trying to get my IDE to communicate effectively with
    github. Also, setting up github and making sure everything updated correctly. It took me a minute to realize that I
    couldn't create a file structure on github directly. I instead created the files on my local machine and then pushed
    them there. Also, my IDE has a button to commit, but commit doesn't equal push.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Well, I learned everything that I did on this page. I haven't really played around with
    html before, and what little I had done was nearly a decade ago. It seems pretty straightforward so far. I wanted
    everything to be indented correctly, so I googled how to do that.</p>

<h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">The most helpful resource for me personally has always been any "Head First" book.
Some people love these books and others hate them. The abstract way they present the information is conducive to
my learning style. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Other than that book, searching the internet for the specifics of exactly what I'm
trying to figure out, is usually the fastest solution. For instance, I wanted everything to be indented equally, so I
searched for that. </p>
